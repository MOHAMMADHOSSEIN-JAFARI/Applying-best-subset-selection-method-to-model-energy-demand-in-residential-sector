The research aims to explain the factors mostly influence residential sector energy
demand in Italy. The data is collected from different sources including ISTAT,
and EUROSTAT considering six explanatory variables including resident population,
purchasing power parities, household size, median household income, residential
electricity cost, and the cost of residential natural gas for the period of eleven years
from 2009 to 2019. Best subset selection method is applied for the sake of choosing
the optimal number of regressors by comparing different criteria including R2, RSS,
Mallows’s C
p, AIC, and BIC. After that, an ordinary least squares regression model
is implemented on selected independent variables in order to investigate how they can
explain household energy consumption in Italy. The research suggests that an increase
in resident population density in Italy would in fact lead to a decrease in overall
energy consumption. Thus, in order to design more a comprehensive energy plan, and
to improve the accuracy of energy consumption forecasts, resident population should
be fully considered. Besides, we also find several policy implications that could be
introduced to ensure Italy’s energy independence
